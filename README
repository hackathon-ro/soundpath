SoundPath iOS App.

    SoundPath allows the user to discover new music by navigating through a tree of bands related to the users liked bands on Facebook.

    The app starts by retrieving the users' liked bands and arranging them as nodes. By tapping on a node the App will query the backend API and get a list of bands that were liked by the previously selected band. The subsequent bands will be arranged as a graph, being connected by edges to the previous node. The user can now repeat the same action on the newly retrieved nodes thus expanding his network.
